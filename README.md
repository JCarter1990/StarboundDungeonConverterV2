# StarboundDungeonConverterV2
An improved version of the other dungeon converter, this version converts png's into a usable tiled map.

#Instructions
1.Copy the png's you want converted into the input folder.
2.Run the program and it will ask for the path to the .dungeon file that those images are a part of.
3.If all goes well there shouldn't be any problems and the new maps will be in the output folder.

#Bugs
Wires won't be converted and might crash the program if there are any files with wires in the name.
Some supports will face the wrong way, i can't fix that. It's easy enough to fix in tiled.
Some lights might also be positioned slightly wrong, i also can't fix that because they have the same problem that the supports do.
